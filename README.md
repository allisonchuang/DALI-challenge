# What I did
I was able to complete the lab.
* I made sure my title and tags didn't overflow our of their divs and used ellipses
* I also used word breaks in case of long words
* If one of the input fields is not entered, I have a div that is displayed in my editing post page that says "click to add content"

## Signing in / Signing Up
To sign in, click on the 'sign in' button on the top right corner of the nav bar. If you want to sign up, there is a button next to the sign in button on the sign in page. Vise versa for the sign up page. If the user signs in or signs up incorrectly, the blog will tell them

# What worked
Once I got all the backend working correctly, the frontend for this lab was very easy.

# What didn't work
Error handling was a little tricky to figure out.

# Extra credit
overflow text handling, empty content handling, timestamp on each post. <br />
On the home posts page you can see who created the post and the date. <br />
On the single post page you can now see who created the post, their profile picture, and the date and time the post was created.<br />
The blog page will also tell the user if they have made a mistake signing in or signing up.
