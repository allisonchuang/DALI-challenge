# About Me
My name is Allison Chuang and I am from Albany, California. I am interested in computer science, human centered design, and psychology. I want to understand how people think in order to create a technology or system that betters people's lives and makes things simpler/more efficient. I am currently proficient in java and C, and can easily pick up Python as well (CS1 was a long time ago). On the frontend side I am comfortable with html, css, and react and redux.

# About the challenge
I completed the Dev II challenge. You can see all the members in DALI by default, but if you click the toggle in the top left corner, you will see only the members in DALI that are on in 17S. In addition, I was able to access the location provided by the members' latitude and longitude by making an axios call to google developers maps. Finally, the dashboard appropriately handles members whose urls provided in the api are pdfs. For these members, the program searches for the pdf through the mappy json instead of directly linking to the member's website.
