# About Me
My name is Allison Chuang and I am from Albany, California. I am interested in computer science, human centered design, and psychology. I want to understand how people think in order to create a technology or system that betters people's lives and makes things simpler/more efficient. I am currently proficient in java and C, and can easily pick up Python as well (CS1 was a long time ago). On the frontend side I am comfortable with html, css, and react and redux.

# About the challenge
I completed the Dev II challenge. You can see all the members in DALI by default, but if you click the toggle in the top left corner, you will see only the members in DALI that are on in 17S.
