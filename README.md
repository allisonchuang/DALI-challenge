# What I did
I was able to complete the lab.
* I created extra actions just for navigation purposes
* I made sure my title and tags didn't overflow our of their divs and used ellipses
* I also used word breaks in case of long words
* If one of the input fields is not entered, I have a div that is displayed in my editing post page that says "click to add content"

# What worked
I was able to get all my actions working. Once I got that to work, the lab was pretty smooth sailing

# What didn't work
Took me a while to figure out axios and page fetching

# Extra credit
overflow text handling, empty content handling
